					<p>I’m glad I asked you out on this day [three] years ago. Happy anniversary!!

We are given 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 arms, 2 legs but one heart because we're supposed to find the other and I found you ❤️. Life with you is much happier and sweeter than it was before you came into the picture. No one makes me laugh the way you do. I don’t know how I got so lucky to get a girl like you, but I’m thankful every single day. Thanks for being the best part of my day—every day!!! Like the smiles in our selfies, you light up my life. I love you!!! From sending you good night texts to wishing you good morning, everything seems sweeter since I met you. From late night talk to romantic dates, you’ve given me some of life’s sweetest memories. Having you by my side makes me the happiest, most grateful and luckiest person in the world. My heart is all yours and I don't regret giving it to you not one bit. I can't bored of you coz you are like an ocean!!!! I want to love you, adore you, take care of you and make you the happiest person there ever was for all of time. The good things in life are better with you. I am so blessed to be loved to someone as wonderful as you. 
I can’t wait to see what’s to come for us. <div class="ig1">
